It's easy to take those features for granted, but every once in a while peeking under the hood can teach us what makes things work and what doesn't.</p><p>What we'll cover:</p><ul><li>Automatic back-propagation</li><li>How to implement a few basic layers</li><li>How to create a training loop</li></ul><p>If you want to jump straight to the code, feel free to scroll to the second half of the post or try it live in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/eisenjulian/slides/blob/master/NN_from_scratch/notebook.ipynb">Colab Notebook</a>.</p><p>The design choices are heavily based on <a href="https://github.com/explosion/thinc">Thinc</a>'s Deep Learning library since they came up with the smart idea of using  closures and the stack to share and keep track of intermediate results while calculating gradients. This post is also inspired by Jeremy Howard's great <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html">PyTorch tutorial</a>, but taking it one more step towards the bottom getting rid of <code>autograd</code>.</p><h2 id="a-word-on-notation">A word on notation</h2><p>Notation can often be a source of confusion, but it can also help us develop the right intuition. In the context of calculus for back propagation, we can focus on functions or on variables to think about derivatives. These are the edges and nodes in the computational graph. We will get to the same results either way, but I find that focusing on variables helps to make things more natural.</p><ul><li>Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, then the gradient is the $n$-dimensional row vector of partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial_j }(x)$</li><li>If $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ then the Jacobian matrix is an $m\times n$ matrix such that the $i^{\text{th}}$ is the gradient of $f$ restricted to the $i$ coordinate:<br>$$Jf(x)_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial_j}(x)$$</li><li>For a function $f$ and two vectors $a$ and $b$ such that $a = f(b)$, whenever $f$ is clear from context we can write $\frac{\partial a}{\partial b}$ to denote the Jacobian $Jf$, or gradient if $a$ is a real number.</li></ul><h2 id="the-chain-rule">The chain rule</h2><p>If we have three vectors in three vector spaces $a\in A$, $b\in B$, and $c\in C$ and two differentiable functions $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ such that $f(a) = b$ and $g(b) = c$ we can get the Jacobian of the composition as a matrix product of the Jacobian of $f$ and $g$:</p><p>$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial a} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial b} \cdot \frac{\partial b}{\partial a}$$</p><p>That's the chain rule in all its glory. The back-propagation algorithm, originally described in the '60s and '70s is the application of the chain rule to calculate gradients of a real function with respect to its various parameters.</p><p>Keep in mind that our end goal is to find a minimum (hopefully global) of a function by taking steps in the opposite direction of the said gradient, because locally at least this will take it downwards. This is how it looks when we have two parameters to optimize.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://eisenjulian.github.io/content/images/2019/03/gradient_descent.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Neural Networks in 100 lines of pure Python"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://jed-ai.github.io/py1_gd_animation/">7 Simple Steps To Visualize And Animate The Gradient Descent Algorithm</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="reverse-mode-differentiation">Reverse mode differentiation</h2><p>If we compose many functions $f_i(a_i) = a_{i+1}$ instead of just two, then we can apply that formula repeatedly and conclude that</p><p>$$\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_1} = \frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-1}} \cdots \frac{\partial a_3}{\partial a_2}\cdot\frac{\partial a_2}{\partial a_1}$$</p><p>Of the many ways we can compute this product, the most common are from left to right or from right to left. </p><p>In practice, if $a_n$ is a scalar we will calculate the full gradient by starting with the row vector $\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-1}}$ and multiplying by the Jacobians $\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial a_{i-1}}$ on the right one at a time. This operation is sometimes referred as <em>VJP</em>, or <em>Vector-Jacobian Product</em>. The whole process is known as <strong>reverse mode</strong> differentiation, because as intermediate results we gradually compute the gradients working from the last one $\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-1}}$ backward through $\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-2}}$, $\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-3}}$, etc. In the end, we know the gradient of $a_n$ with respect to all other variables.</p><p>$$\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-1}} \rightarrow \frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_{n-2}} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_1}$$</p><p>In contrast, <strong>forward mode</strong> does the exact opposite. It starts from one Jacobian like $\frac{\partial a_2}{\partial a_1}$ and multiplies on the left by $\frac{\partial a_3}{\partial a_2}$ to calculate $\frac{\partial a_3}{\partial a_1}$. If we keep multiplying by $\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial a_{i-1}}$ we'll gradually get the derivatives of all other variables with respect to $a_1$. When $a_1$ is a scalar, all the matrixes on the right side of the products are column vectors, and this is called a <em>Jacobian-Vector Product</em> (or <em>JVP</em>).</p><p>$$\frac{\partial a_n}{\partial a_1} \leftarrow\cdots\leftarrow \frac{\partial a_2}{\partial a_1} \leftarrow  \frac{\partial a_2}{\partial a_1}$$</p><p>For back propagation, as you might have guessed, we are interested in the first of this two, since there's a single value we want on top, the loss function, derived with respect to multiple variables, the weights. Forward mode could still be used to compute those gradients, but it would be far less efficient since we would have to repeat the process multiple times.</p><p>This sounds like a lot of high-dimensional matrix products, but the trick is that very often the Jacobian matrixes will be sparse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix">block</a> or even diagonal and, because we only care about the result of multiplying it by a row vector on the left, we won't need to compute or store it explicitly</p><p>In this article, we are focusing on a sequential composition of layers, but the same ideas apply to any algorithm or computational graph that we use to get to the result. Yet another nice description of reverse and forward mode in a more general context is given <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="link-to-deep-neural-networks">Link to deep neural networks</h2><p>In the typical setting for supervised machine learning, we have a big complex function that takes in a tensor of numerical features for our labeled samples, and several tensors that correspond to weights that characterize the model.</p><p>The loss, as a scalar function of both the samples and weights, is a measure of how far the model output was from the expected labels. We want to minimize it to find the most suitable weights. In deep learning, this function is expressed as a composition of simpler functions, each of which is easy to differentiate. All of them but the last are what we refer to as layers, and each layer usually has two sets of parameters: the inputs (which can be the output of the previous layer) and the weights. </p><p>The last function is the loss metric, which also has two sets of parameters: model output $y$ and the true labels $\hat{y}$. For example, if the loss metric $l$ is the mean square error then $\frac{\partial l}{\partial y}$ is $2\  \text{avg}(y - \hat{y})$. The gradient of the loss will be the starting row vector to apply reverse mode differentiation.</p><h2 id="autograd">Autograd</h2><p>The ideas behind Automatic Differentiation are quite mature. It can be done in runtime or during compilation, which can have a dramatic impact on performance. I recommend the <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">HIPS autograd</a> Python package for a thorough explanation of some of the concepts. </p><p>The core idea, however, is always the same, and we have known it ever since we started computing derivatives in school. If we can keep track of the computations that resulted in the final scalar output and we know how to differentiate each simple operation (sums and products, powers, exponentials, and logarithms, ...), we can recover the gradient of the output.</p><p>Let's say that we have some intermediate linear layer $f$ which is characterized by a matrix multiplication (let's leave the bias out for a sec):</p><p>$$y = f(x, w) = x\cdot w$$</p><p>In order to tune the values of $w$ with gradient descent, we need to compute the gradient $\frac{\partial l}{\partial w}$. The key observation that it's enough to know how changes in $y$ will affect $l$ to do that.</p><blockquote>The contract that any layer has to satisfy is the following: if I tell you the gradient of the loss with respect to your outputs, you can tell me the gradient with respect to your inputs, which are in turn the previous layer outputs.</blockquote><p>Now we can apply the chain rule twice: for the gradient with respect to $w$ we get that </p><p>$$\frac{\partial l}{\partial w} =\frac{\partial l}{\partial y}\cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial l}{\partial y} \cdot x^t $$</p><p>and with respect to $x$</p><p>$$\frac{\partial l}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial l}{\partial y}\cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial l}{\partial y} \cdot w $$ </p><p>So we can both pass a gradient backward to enable previous layers to update themselves and update the internal layer weights to optimize the loss, and that's it!</p><h2 id="implementation-time">Implementation time</h2><p>Let's look at the code, or try it live in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/eisenjulian/slides/blob/master/NN_from_scratch/notebook.ipynb">Colab Notebook</a>. We can start with a class that encapsulates a tensor and its gradients</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-python">class Parameter():

    self.tensor = tensor
    self.gradient = np.zeros_like(self.tensor)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now we can create the layer class, the key idea is that during a forward pass we return both the layer output and function that can receive the gradient of the loss with respect to the outputs and can return the gradient with respect to the inputs, updating the weight gradients in the process.</p><p>This is because while evaluating the model layer by layer there's no way to calculate the gradients if we don't know the final loss yet, instead the best thing you can do is return a function that CAN calculate the gradient later. And that function will only be called after we completed the forward evaluation, when you know the loss and you have all the necessary info to compute the gradients in that layer.</p><p>The training process will then have three steps, calculate the forward step, then the backward steps accumulate the gradients, and finally updating the weights. It’s important to do this at the end	 since weights can be reused in multiple layers and we don’t want to mutate the weights before time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-python">class Layer:

We will use this dataset to train a binary classification model, able to predict whether a review is positive or negative.</p><p>For illustration, here’s a piece of a negative review (with 2 stars) in the dataset:</p><blockquote><em><em><em>Now, I LOVE Italian horror films. The cheesier they are, the better. However, this is not cheesy Italian. This is week-old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. It is amateur hour on every level.

For text classification, it is standard to limit the size of the vocabulary to prevent the dataset from becoming too sparse and high dimensional, causing potential overfitting.

Embeddings are a dense low-dimensional representation of sparse high-dimensional data. This allows our model to learn a more meaningful representation of each token, rather than just an index. While an individual dimension is not meaningful, the low-dimensional space — when learned from a large enough corpus — has been shown to capture relations such as tense, plural, gender, thematic relatedness, and many more. We can add word embeddings by converting our existing feature column into an <code>embedding_column</code>. The representation seen by the model is the mean of the embeddings for each token (see the <code>combiner</code> argument in the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column" rel="nofollow noopener">docs</a>). We can plug in the embedded features into a pre-canned <code>DNNClassifier</code>.</p><p>A note for the keen observer: an <code>embedding_column</code> is just an efficient way of applying a fully connected layer to the sparse binary feature vector of tokens, which is multiplied by a constant depending of the chosen combiner. A direct consequence of this is that it wouldn’t make sense to use an <code>embedding_column</code>directly in a <code>LinearClassifier</code> because two consecutive linear layers without non-linearities in between add no prediction power to the model, unless of course the embeddings are pre-trained.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-python">embedding_size = 50

Recurrent models such as this are some of the most successful building blocks for NLP applications. An LSTM processes the entire document sequentially, recursing over the sequence with its cell while storing the current state of the sequence in its memory.</p><p>One of the drawbacks of recurrent models compared to CNNs is that, because of the nature of recursion, models turn out deeper and more complex, which usually produces slower training time and worse convergence. LSTMs (and RNNs in general) can suffer convergence issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, that said, with sufficient tuning they can obtain state-of-the-art results for many problems. As a rule of thumb CNNs are good at feature extraction, while RNNs excel at tasks that depend on the meaning of the whole sentence, like question answering or machine translation.</p><p>Each cell processes one token embedding at a time and updates its internal state based on a differentiable computation that depends on both the embedding vector <em>x</em> at time <em>t</em>​ and the previous state <em>h</em> at time <em>t−1</em>​.

It’s a good practice to associate saved checkpoints with the branch of code with which they were created.</p><p>If you are interested in exporting the models to disk in a fully recoverable way, you might want to look into the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model#using_savedmodel_with_estimators" rel="nofollow noopener">SavedModel</a> class, which is especially useful for serving your model through an API using <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/serving" rel="nofollow noopener">TensorFlow Serving</a> or loading it in the browser with <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">TensorFlow.js</a>.</p><p>In this blog post, we explored how to use estimators for text classification, in particular for the IMDB Reviews Dataset. We trained and visualized our own embeddings, as well as loaded pre-trained ones. We started from a simple baseline and made our way to convolutional neural networks and LSTMs.</p><p>For more details, be sure to check out:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://github.com/eisenjulian/nlp_estimator_tutorial/blob/master/nlp_estimators.ipynb" rel="nofollow noopener">Jupyter Notebook</a> that can run locally, or on <a href="https://goo.gl/fXsCra" rel="nofollow noopener">Colaboratory</a>.</li><li>The complete <a href="https://github.com/eisenjulian/nlp_estimator_tutorial/blob/master/nlp_estimators.py" rel="nofollow noopener">source code</a> for this blog post.</li><li>The TensorFlow <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding" rel="nofollow noopener">Embedding</a> guide.</li><li>The TensorFlow <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec" rel="nofollow noopener">Vector Representation of Words</a> tutorial.</li><li>The <em>NLTK</em> <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Processing Raw Text</a> chapter on how to design langage pipelines.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Thanks for reading!
